# kibana-time-plugin
Widget to view and edit the time range from within dashboards. This plugin started as a work around for issue [Timepicker as part of embedded dashboard](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/2739).

Use this widget to view and edit the time range from within dashboards. Use the carousel controls to switch between 'quick', 'relative', 'absolute', and 'time animation' inputs.

Use the time animation controls to easily explore data by time blocks. Click and drag on the time animation bar to select a time range. Grab the brush to move or resize. Click outside of the brush to remove. Use the step buttons to advance to the next time block.
