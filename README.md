# kibana-carousel-plugin

This isn't working yet...

I am trying to model it after the Pure CSS Netflix Video Carousel found here.

My carousel project includes a branch that uses the Bootstrap carousel to show just one slide at a time as well as an attempt to use the Slick carousel (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).  I had trouble getting that to build into Kibana properly and abandoned Slick in favor of the pure CSS version.  It might be possible for a knowledgeable Kibana developer to salvage the Slick branch with little effort.  I was just out of my depth.

Full disclosure, the skeleton for my work comes from Nathan Reese's time plugin
